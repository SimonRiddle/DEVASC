# Methods, functions, modules, and classes

## Clean code

* What is clean code?
    * Neat formatting, keep it consistent
        * Use tabs/spaces consistently
        * Use the correct indentation level in the entire file
    * Is the code intuitive and organised well?
    * Is the code documented and commented?
    * Can the common code be reused throughout other projects?

* The goal of clean code is to allow many developers to make additions and edit your code without having to come to you, to ask how xyz works
* If you do not create clean code, the code becomes technical debt

## Methods and functions

### Introduction 

* A block of code which perform tasks when executed
* Code which happens more than once should be encapsulated in a method or function
* Methods and functions can be ran as many times as the developer wishes
* Create variables (arguments) in your code and refer to them to make your code simpler in functions & methods

### Methods vs function

* Methods are standalone code blocks, associated with an object, for OO programming
* Functions are standalone code blocks
